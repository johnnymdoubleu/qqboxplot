Description: This package implements the q-q boxplot.  It is implemented as an
    extension to ggplot2.  The q-q boxplot is an amalgam of the boxplot and the
    q-q plot and allows the user to rapidly examine summary statistics and tail
    behavior for multiple distributions in the same pane.  As an extension of
    the ggplot2 implementation of the boxplot, possible modifications to the 
    boxplot extend to the q-q boxplot.
